<!-- The purpose of the site is to provide a space for musicians to work together more easily. Users 

would post their music and according to their preferences they can invite people to add on to 

their work or people can request to collab. Users would post they’re flp files directly to the site. 

It’s important to create this site because it’s harder nowadays to find third spaces to congregate 

and explore hobbies together. -->

<!-- The Homepage would be a library of users with pickable categories and a user dashboard for 

them to upload and curate their content.

The purpose would be to quickly get the user in to action -->

<!-- The next page would be the user’s personal library with all of they’re uploads and 

collaborations. A place to get a full over view of your work. -->

<!-- The next page with be trending, random and popular within genre users. The purpose is for 

users to get new inspirations and more exposure to other users. -->

<!-- The next page will be a form to request collabs with other musicians -->
